    Successive Selection
    a video set
    sequentially select a segment
    divide 5 sets
    center: anchor zone
    else: positive zone
    both sides: negative zone

    python Triplet1.py

    Supplement Selection
    a video set
    sequentially select a segment
    anchor zone
    both sides: 
    negative zone
    same action segments
    positive zone

    python Triplet2.py

- triplet_main.py
    Reorganization Selection
    all videos in one dataset
    𝑣=(𝑣_1,𝑣_2, …, 𝑣_𝑛 )
    random select video and action
    anchor zone(purple intersection)
    same video, diff actions
    negative zone (red row)
    diff videos, same actions
    positive zone (green column)
